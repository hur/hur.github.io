I'm a 4th year Computer Science & Mathematics student at The University of Edinburgh. 

I am interested in security, distributed systems, low-level operating systems concepts, and much more.

I have internship experience in DevOps and Digital Forensics & Incident Response.

# CTF placements and other security achievements
I enjoy playing CTFs, both solo and with my university team [SIGINT](https://sigint.mx/about/).

Here are some individual achievements I am proud of, in no particular order:
- Yellow belt in [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/belts) (24/09/2022)
- Completed Offshore, a HackTheBox pro lab focusing on Active Directory exploitation.
