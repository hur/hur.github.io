I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at The University of Edinburgh. 

My interests span from distributed systems to low-level operating systems concepts, with security being another interest.

I enjoy things like Kubernetes, learning about the Linux Kernel, Android, Operating Systems, Digital Forensics and Incident Response and much more. 

I'm mostly using Python, C and Rust, but know a bunch more and pick up new languages whenever needed. The next language I learn will probably be Elixir, and Go is also interesting.
