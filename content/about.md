I'm a 4th year Computer Science & Mathematics student at The University of Edinburgh. 

My interests span from distributed systems to low-level operating systems concepts, with security being another interest. 

I'm mostly using Python, C and Rust, but know a bunch more and pick up new languages whenever needed.

# CTF placements and other security achievements
I enjoy playing CTFs, both solo and with my university team [SIGINT](https://sigint.mx/about/).

Here are some individual achievements I am proud of, in no particular order:
- Yellow belt in [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/belts) (24/09/2022)
- 13th full clear of [h4ck1ng google](https://h4ck1ng.google/) (10/10/2022)
- Completed Offshore, a HackTheBox pro lab focusing on Active Directory exploitation.
